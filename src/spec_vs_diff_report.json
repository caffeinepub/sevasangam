  "summary": "The diff clearly adds an \"Admin Login\" button in the desktop header actions and wires it to navigate to \"/admin-login\". Due to truncation of the mobile menu portion and absence of route/guard diffs, mobile-menu placement and admin-route redirect behavior cannot be fully verified from the provided changes.",

      "description": "Clearing the React Query cache on admin logout (queryClient.clear())",
      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is UI navigation only and explicitly says not to change the admin authentication mechanism or backend behavior; clearing the query cache changes client-side session/data behavior beyond adding a navigation entry point.",
